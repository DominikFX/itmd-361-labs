  <h1>Lab 01: A Little About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm Dominik Kulawiak, a 3rd year undergrad here at IIT. Some of my hobbies include working with technology and ways to improve and solve issues with it. I'm a fan of the color red but only a specific shade of it. An activity I enjoy is solving Escape Rooms as it's intresting to see the puzzles people can come up with, while exercising a bit of your brian.</p>
